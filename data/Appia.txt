Launch an Optimization based on the current Scope or the current selection. You can apply an optional Initial Grouping Rule
during the optimization.
Export data based on Scope, New Scope, or Departure Selection. The Format can be .XLXS or .CSV.
Importing the same file that was exported after changes have been made and saved.
Update or create a Departure Group based on the current Departure selection from the Departure List.
Dashboard Synchronization
Users can utilize multiple tabs simultaneously across multiple monitors, allowing for seamless multitasking and improved visibility of critical data. Users’ scope and departure selection will be
synchronized across multiple tabs and dashboards which gives the flexibility to configure different widget customization on each tab, reflecting data at varying aggregation levels or focusing on
specific analytical perspectives.
Remarks
Users will be able to select and load one scope from the list of existing scopes to be applied to their dashboard.
The filters list will be specified for each Widget (e.g., cabin, control class, indicators ...)
Year-over-year comparisons will depend on the amount of historical data and the comparison departure date range, as well as the reservation horizon and the Days Before Departure (DBD)
range.
The last used Dashboard and Scope will appear by default when opening Appia.
7Scope
Overview
A scope is a set of boundaries defined by selecting scope criteria that will search for departures matching those constraints. Scope Management is the process of creating, saving, editing and
deleting scopes. Scopes are cross-functional in Appia and allow users to perform analysis, take corrective actions and automate actions on a specific set of departures. Currently, scopes can be
used in the departure list to search for Departures and can be managed in the scope library.
Benefits
You will be able to analyze a situation corresponding to a scope and then use the same scope to, for example, create a business Rule or a Departure Grouping configuration.
Create a new scope, change an existing one, or delete a scope.
Enjoy uncluttered and organized departure lists by filtering out irrelevant or unwanted results while getting your intended results faster
Speed up workflows by reusing scopes
Search for Departures in the Dashboard based on critical KPIs
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia V, Select Dashboards and then Departure Dashboard.
Create or change a Scope:
Create Scope: Click on the Scope name field and select "New Scope"
Change Scope: Click on the Scope name field and select the existing Scope you want to modify
A toggle switch will allow you to "Show only my Scopes" in the drop-down list.
Define the Scope Criteria:
ADD a new scope criterion by clicking on "Add New Criteria". Choose any of the available search fields and
select the entries you wish to include
EDIT an existing scope criterion by clicking on it. Add or remove selections
DELETE an existing scope criterion by clicking on the x at the right side of the criterion
Click on "Save Scope" to save the current scope or click on "Save as New Scope" to create a new scope. A scope
name is limited to 45 characters
Click on “Compare” to open a new tab with the “Scope Comparison” screen
Remarks
A scope criterion consists of a search field in which you can select one or more values. Within each scope criterion, all selected values are linked by a logical OR. If a range is selected, all values
between the start and end values are selected. All scope criteria are connected by a logical AND, therefore the outcome of the inclusion of all boundaries set in the scope criteria yields the list of
departures matched by the scope.
When adding new scope criteria to the scope you can choose to include or exclude the selected values. Not all search fields allow exclusions.
You can choose to reuse the same search field in more than one scope criterion, allowing for an advanced search pattern such as:
1. Search for a Departure matching exactly two values by using two scope criteria with the same search field.
2. Search for a Departure matching exactly one value by using one scope criterion including the value you are looking for and one scope criterion using the same search field excluding the
value that you don’t want to include.
Scopes can be saved and loaded by the user to avoid having to create a new Scope each time.
Limiting the modification/deletion of a Scope associated with a Configuration will act as a safeguard to lessen the negative impact on the results of the optimization
Manager role - will be permitted to edit existing Scopes associated with Configurations with a warning message
User role – will not be permitted to edit existing Scopes associated with Configurations
The link between a Scope and a Configuration must be detached before deleting the Scope.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
The following search fields can be used to create a Scope Criteria:

KPIs impacted by Main OD
The following KPIs take the Main OD into account in their formula:
Rec Lowest Available Class (updated during an optimization)
Obs Lowest Available Class (updated during the nightly batch process)
Min Price (updated during the nightly batch process)
Rec Comp Delta (updated during an optimization)
Min Price and Rec Comp Delta are updated following a Competition Import. If a Main OD has been updated, the next time there is a Competition Import, both Min Price and Rec Comp Delta will
take the latest Main OD.
Regarding the Rec/Obs lowest available class,
1. The user creates/updates a Main OD configuration.
2. The Main OD changes are applied to the matching departure during the nightly batch process which consists of import, recalculation of KPIs, optimization, and report generation.
A Main OD update does not trigger the recalculation of the following KPIs:
Obs Lowest Available Class
Min Price
A Main OD update does not trigger the optimization of the departure so the following KPIs will not be updated:
Rec Lowest Available Class
Rec Comp delta
3. If, during the import, the system detects a recalculation trigger such as a Booking Threshold, then Obs Lowest Available Class will be updated with the latest Main OD.
4. If, after the import, the system detects an optimization trigger such as a Checkpoint, then Rec Lowest Available Class will be updated with the latest Main OD.
Recalculation and optimization triggers can differ, so there may exist a situation where the Rec Lowest Available Class that has been calculated with a different Main OD than the Obs Lowest
Available Class.
Remarks
The Departure List shows the number of departure records in the scope. The presentation of the Departure List allows for infinite scrolling down, instead of in a page format, 50 records per scroll.
As we scroll down the list, new records are added to the view, and all records above remain available to view if we scroll back up.
Column information is sortable by clicking on the column header. A multiple column sort is possible by clicking on columns in a specific order. (i.e. First column - primary sort, Second column -
secondary sort, and third column - tertiary sort). Each sorted column header will display a small number indicating its position in the sorting order.
After any Scope or Criteria changes, there are no selected Departure(s). The user has to select a Departure before any selection based widgets display data. The only exception is when there is
a Departure that matches the criteria, in which case that Departure will be selected automatically. If the user was building a list of Departures for a report or optimization, then they have to start
over selecting Departures.
The selection widgets will only display data when there is only one departure selected. Otherwise the message "Please select a single Departure to display data" will be displayed.

15Departure Scatter
Overview
The Departure Scatter Widget is synchronized with the Scope and its selected criteria. It is recommended to first select only some criteria to reduce the size of the scope in order to make the
Departure Scatter Widget more practical.
Analysts can configure the scatter plot in order to compare a departure's performance with similar departures by viewing Observed/Forecasted LF/Yield and DBD. The past six weeks of
Departures might be a good starting point.
Knowing a Departure's demand and yield profile by day of week and days before departure is crucial for pricing strategy applications. A prime departure will have a high load factor, and the yield
will reflect the passenger's business or leisure distribution. This information allows for the protection of high-yield demand on prime departures and the steering of price-sensitive demand toward
lower load factor departures. Typically, lower-yield demand books earlier in the reservation horizon, and high-yield demand books closer to departure, so having a view by days before departure
can be informative.
Benefits
The Departure Scatter Widget provides a graphical performance comparison of LF and Yield, or either LF or Yield compared to DBD. It allows users to:
View performance by Departure, Date, and Day of Week, over the Horizon by DBD
Observe train categories by LF and Yield clusters
Analyze Departure performance using personalized indicators
Identify inconsistencies between departures, and take action
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Dashboards and then Departure Dashboard. If necessary, add the Widget "Departure Scatter".
The floating panel highlights a particular Departure number, Departure date, and Day of Week.
The widget and filter are highlighted when the filter icon in the upper right corner of the Widget is clicked. This also opens a drop-down list for Group by in the right-side panel. The two axes, X
and Y, allow the user to select DBD, Obs or Fcst data and can be interchanged to suit the user’s preference.

KPI Indicators
Description
CapacityOperational Capacity - aggregated at the departure, departure cabin, or leg-cabin level.
BookingsSum of observed individual bookings from the CRS for a given leg, OD, cabin and Departure, less cancellations.
Load FactorAn indicator used to measure the utilization of the seats on offer (i.e.,the operational capacity)(abbr. LF). LF may be calculated differently depending on the level of
aggregation, but in general it is the ratio of RPK to ASK. However, in the case of individual legs, it is usually calculated as the ratio of passenger bookings to leg capacity.
LF only takes into account the operational capacity.
RevenueRevenue earned from passenger bookings.
RASKRevenue per available seat kilometre (abbr. RASK) A unit to measure the revenue earned by offered seats per kilometre (R/ASK), stated as cents per ASK.
YieldYield per revenue passenger kilometre (abbr. Y/RPK or yield per RPK (YRPK)) Revenue divided by revenue passenger kilometres. Yield is stated as cents per passenger
kilometre.
Elements and KPI
Description
ObservedObserved sum of (both individual and group bookings for example) for both reservable and non-reservable control classes.
HistoricalObserved historical value at the same days-before-departure (DBD) of the comparison reference.
Delta ObservedThe difference between the Observed data and Historical data.
Forecasted FinalForecasted final (bookings for example), for both reservable and non-reservable control classes. The sum of the current Observed Bookings and all Forecast

25Special Events
Overview
The Special Event Widget allows you to view events that have a potential impact on the demand of the OD and their respective Departures in the Departure List.
Different types of events can affect a departure/OD demand:
Holidays - such as statutory or bank holidays, school holidays, summer vacations, or spring break
Maintenance - Rail network and equipment maintenance such as equipment failures, rail obstructions, planned repairs
Social Movements - Labour strikes, protest marches, etc.
Unforeseen events - Natural disasters, artificial disasters, conflicts, or criminal acts
There are two views:
Calendar view
Events within the Scope are highlighted
Events outside the Scope are displayed but with a faded colour
List view
Events listed are linked to the Scope
Benefits
Enables you to have a better understanding as to why a Departure demand is lower or high than expected
Gives you a quick heads-up of what's on the horizon so you can take the appropriate actions
The events displayed on the widget can help you narrow your scope on the departures impacted by particular events
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Dashboards and then Departure Dashboard. If necessary, add the Special Events Widget.
The Special Events calendar displays months in chronological order based on the first date in the Scope defined by the user. The Widget can be expanded to display a maximum of 24 months.
The Scope Event list displays, in chronological order, the Special Events that are associated to the Scope defined by the user.
You can visualize at most three events on a single date. Supplementary events beyond the three will have an interactive badge with the total number of events. Clicking on the badge will open a
floating panel with the list of events.
Remarks
If multiple events exist on a single date then the following priorities will apply:
1. The events must be listed in chronological order
2. The event with the longest date range must have priority
3. If two events start on the same day and impact the same dates, then the events must be listed in alphabetical order
If the current date has an event that predates the current longest event:
The event that predates the current longest event must keep its predetermined position
The current longest event must now keep its position until its end date
If the current date has at least three events that predate the current longest event:
The event will not be displayed on the calendar view until a vacant spot opens - the event must now have an indicator that shows that it had started on an earlier date - its position will be
determined by the criteria in the above remarks.

27Cancellation - Booking Horizon
Overview
The Cancellation - Booking Horizon Widget not only forecasts future demand but also predicts booking cancellations. It generates predictions for both demand and cancellation volumes at the
same level, including itinerary and sales period. The widget is aligned with the departures selected in the Departure List. The Widget Filter will allow for a Display choice of Aggregation, Cabin
and Control Class.
Benefits
Early detection of demand shifts allows analysts to capitalize on surges in demand or mitigating potential losses from cancellations
Improved decision making on inventory adjustments by aligning availability with the actual pace of bookings and cancellations throughout the booking window
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Dashboards and then Departure Dashboard. If necessary, add the Widget "Cancellation - Booking Horizon".
Within this widget, users can visualize the observed and forecasted bookings and cancellations over the sales horizon. A period represents the interval between two checkpoints. Bookings are
represented by a positive bar above the x-axis, while cancellations are denoted by a bar extending below the x-axis. There are two y-axes, one is the Incremental Load Factor, and the other is the
Cumulative Load Factor.
Remarks
Cumulative Calculation:
Observed Load Factor = The sum of Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKs) divided by the sum of Available Seat Kilometers (ASKs) for a given Departure
Observed Cancellation Load Factor = The sum of Cancellation Passenger Kilometers (CPKs) divided by the sum of ASKS for a given Departure
Incremental Calculation:
Observed Load Factor = The sum of RPKs divided by the sum of ASKs for a given Departure for a given period
Observed Cancellation Load Factor = The sum of CPKs divided by the sum of ASKs for a given Departure for a given Period

31Competition Analysis
Overview
The Competition Analysis Widget allows users to compare competitor fares, view price points over the entire day, and filter data based on cabin, competitor, and Origin-Destination (OD) pairs.
Analysts can view mapped competitor data directly on the Competition Analysis Widget, to their own OD departures by leveraging the Competition Configuration feature, as well as matched
price-points that were established through the Competition Matching Strategy .
Purpose : The Competition Analysis widget in Appia provides a visual representation of competitor pricing in relation to your own, for a selected departure and OD. It helps RM analysts make
informed decisions about pricing and strategy by instantly providing competitive pricing intelligence.
Business Intention : This widget is designed to integrate competitive data from Rivalis directly into the Appia workflow. This integration aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
revenue management decisions, such as:
Pricing Strategy Adjustments : Utilizing competitor rate data to adapt pricing strategies.
Dynamic Pricing Overrides : Implementing pricing overrides based on competitor pricing and market demand.
Strategic Promotions : Creating targeted promotions based on competitor offerings.
Market Positioning : Adjusting market positioning based on competitive insights.
Key Benefits :
Productivity : By displaying competitor data alongside your own, the widget streamlines the analysis process.
Dynamic Insights : Get updates on competitor pricing throughout the day, allowing for timely reactions to market changes.
Improved Decision-Making : Understanding competitor price points supports better pricing decisions.
Competitive Advantage : Identifying competitor pricing strategies and strengths/weaknesses allows for strategic adjustments to pricing and schedules.
Widget Description and Functionality
Widget Type : Scatter plot chart.
Levels of Aggregation :
Selected Departure : Shows your selected departure from the Departure List, marked with a purple triangle.
All Your Departures on the OD : Represented by clear triangles.
Competitors' Departures on the OD : Represented by colored circles.

Examples and Best Practices
Example 1 : A competitor has introduced a new, lower fare on a competing departure. Use the widget to assess your price position and adjust your pricing strategy accordingly.
Example 2 : You notice a consistent pattern of a competitor undercutting your prices during peak hours. Use this insight to develop a counter-strategy, such as a targeted price to increase
competitiveness.
Best Practices :
32Use Filters : Focus your analysis on specific cabins, competitors, or ODs relevant to your current needs.
Regular Monitoring : Check the widget throughout the day to stay abreast of competitive changes.
Combine with Other Widgets : Use the Competition Analysis widget in conjunction with the Competition Fare Horizon widget to gain a deeper understanding of competitor pricing trends
over time and the reservation horizon.
Related Features
Competition Configuration in Appia enables users to map competitor data to their own origin-destination (OD) departures. This mapping identifies competitor departures for specific OD
departures in the same market, facilitating competitive strategies. Competition mapping is then leveraged by Appia to display the relevant price-points of the specified competitors directly on the
Competition Analysis Widget .
Competition Matching Strategy uses competitor data to adjust pricing and control inventory by allowing users to automatically open or close control classes in order to be above or below
prices offered by competitors. Users can then visualize the impacts of the pricing strategies on the Competition Analysis Widget .
The Complementary Roles of the Competition Fare Horizon and Competition Analysis Widgets
The Competition Fare Horizon widget and the Competition Analysis widget offer distinct yet complementary perspectives on competitor pricing, allowing users to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the competitive landscape.
The Competition Fare Horizon widget focuses on visualizing the evolution of competitor fares over time . This widget displays the lowest available fare offered by competitors, your
recommended fare, and your price range (highest and lowest fares) for a selected origin-destination (OD) over a specified reservation horizon, expressed as Days Before Departure
(DBD). This historical perspective helps users identify trends in competitor pricing and understand how competitor fares have fluctuated in the past.
Conversely, the Competition Analysis widget provides a snapshot of competitor fares at a specific point in time . It allows users to compare competitor fares for a selected
departure price on a particular OD and displays the prices of all competitor departures on the same OD throughout the day. This widget offers a more granular view of competitor pricing
on a specific day, including the departure times and price points of various competitors.
By using these two widgets together, users can gain a holistic understanding of competitor pricing dynamics:
Historical Trends and Current Snapshot : The Competition Fare Horizon widget provides context by showing historical pricing trends, while the Competition Analysis widget provides a
current snapshot of competitor pricing for a specific departure.
Identifying Pricing Patterns and Anomalies : Users can identify pricing patterns and anomalies by comparing the historical data from the Competition Fare Horizon widget with the
current data from the Competition Analysis widget. For example, if a competitor typically offers lower fares closer to the departure date, this pattern would be visible in the Competition Fare
Horizon widget. If the Competition Analysis widget then shows that the competitor is currently offering higher fares than usual for a specific departure, this could indicate a change in their
pricing strategy or an opportunity to adjust your own pricing accordingly.
Strategic Decision-Making : The insights gained from both widgets can inform strategic pricing decisions. For instance, understanding how competitor fares have evolved over time and
their current pricing position can guide you in setting your own fares and adjusting your inventory controls through strategies like Competition Matching, as discussed in our previous
conversation.
In essence, the Competition Fare Horizon widget and the Competition Analysis widget work in tandem to provide a comprehensive view of competitor pricing, enabling users to make data-driven
decisions and effectively manage their revenue and market share.
The Importance of Competition Intelligence and the Revenue Impact of Market Share
Competitive Intelligence (CI), the systematic and ethical collection and analysis of information about competitors, their offerings, strategies, and market trends, is crucial for businesses in the
passenger transportation industry. In this fast-paced and highly competitive sector, where customer preferences and technology are constantly evolving, CI provides timely and accurate
competitive insights that empower companies to make well-informed strategic decisions and implement timely tactical measures to maintain competitiveness, market share and revenue.
Understanding the relationship between market size, market share, and revenue is essential for making informed strategic decisions. This model provides a simplified framework to analyze the
revenue impact of market share changes and how it affects a company's revenue growth or retention.
Key Metrics:
Market Size : The total value of a specific market, often measured in terms of revenue or units sold.
Market Share : The percentage of the total market size controlled by a particular company.
Average Product Value : The average revenue generated from each unit sold or service provided.
Revenue Growth : The increase in revenue over a specific period compared to the previous period.
Revenue Retention : The ability of a company to retain existing customers and maintain revenue.
Calculating Revenue Impact:
The revenue impact of market share changes can be calculated using the following formula:
Revenue Impact = (Market Size x Market Share Change) x Average Product Value
Interpretation:
A positive or negative market share change will cause some revenue impact, indicating revenue growth or loss.
The magnitude of the revenue impact is influenced by the market size, the extent of the market share change, and the average product value.
Example Scenario:
Consider a company with an average product value of $500 operating in a market with a total size of 1 million passengers annually. If the company's current market share is 20% and increases by
5 percentage points to 25%, the revenue impact can be calculated as follows:
Revenue Impact = (20% of 1 million) = 200,000 x 5% = 10,000 additional passengers x $500 = $5 million.
In this example, a 5 percentage point increase in market share results in a revenue impact of $5 million. This demonstrates the potential revenue impact that can be achieved by gaining or
retaining market share.
Strategic Implications:
By understanding the revenue impact of market share changes, businesses can make strategic decisions to drive growth and optimize their market position. Some key strategies include:
Market Expansion : Targeting new customer segments or geographical markets to increase market size and capture a larger share.
Product Innovation : Developing innovative products or services that differentiate the company from competitors and attract new customers.
Pricing Strategies : Adjusting prices to maintain or gain market share while considering profitability.
Customer Retention : Implementing strategies to retain existing customers and increase customer loyalty to sustain revenue streams.
The relationship between market size, market share, and revenue is vital for businesses to understand. By measuring the value of each percentage gain or loss of market share, companies can
assess the revenue impact and make informed decisions that drive growth and profitability.

Editing inventory
Editing Modes (Single / All)
You can select two editing modes at the top left of the Widget
In Inv View “OD”, “Single OD” and “All ODs”.
In Inv View “Leg”, “Single Leg” and “All Legs”.
When in the "Single " mode, a change made on one Leg/OD has no effect on other Legs/ODs.
When in the “All ” mode, a change made on one Leg/OD is immediately copied to the equivalent Control Class in all other displayed Legs/ODs.
If an OD/Leg is filtered (and therefore not displayed), the change is not copied to it. If you add or remove filters while editing, the changes you have made previously are not affected.
You may also switch modes between "Single" and "All" without affecting changes you have made up to that point
Editable Authorization Fields
By selecting the drop-down menu set to "View Only", you can select one of two Editing modes (Single or All, explained below)
Once you are in an editing session, you can make the following changes to each Control Class:
Modify the Authorization (authorized selling level) by using the "up" or "down" arrow or changing the value
Other Control Classes are updated automatically to respect the nesting constraints
You are warned if an Authorization (AU) value exceeds the Cabin capacity
Set Persistence by applying the lock, with an End DBD to set the days before departure that the persistence will end
If there is a Pack size, you must set a multiple of the Pack size. Pack control classes are used to manage pre-defined groups of seats (seat packs) which are sold together, such as mutually
facing seat pairs, all seats around a table, or separate sections within a cabin (e.g., meeting rooms).
Since these seat packs are sold together at a fixed price independently of the number of passengers travelling in them, Appia assumes that all seats in the group are occupied by travelling
passengers, even if in reality they are not. As a result, AUs of Pack classes are always multiples of the pre-defined group size (referred to as Pack Size), and their bookings are counted based on
the number of seats sold, not the numbers of passengers travelling in them.
Editable Availability Fields
Once you are in an editing session, you can make the following changes to each Control Class:
Modify the minimum, maximum, or set the Availability by clicking on the Availability App number. An “Edit Availability” box will appear with options for “Min, Max, Set” availability. Enter the
appropriate parameter and value of seats that you want and click on “Apply”
The availability request is automatically converted into an AU App value that is entered into the AU App field.
A “U” appears in the Availability Source column to indicate User intervention.
Other Control Classes are updated automatically to respect the nesting constraints
Once requested and confirmed, the entire set of AU and Avail is recalculated - no need to ask for an "Update Availability" like you do with an AU edit.
36Vertical and horizontal propagation
When the user adjusts a minimum, maximum, or sets the availability using the "All ODs" function, then the approved availability will apply to each OD.
Computing Availability after changes to Authorizations
After any change to AU values in the Departure Inventory, the Availability / App column’s outdated values are replaced with “?”
If you hover over the Availability/ App column and click on “Update Availability”, the column is then updated with availability based on the new AUs.
Undoing changes
You can "Undo " on the following actions:
Modifying a value (AU "App", Persist, End DBD)
Changing Edit modes (Single → All, All→ Single)
Changing a filter ("Select OD" / "Select Leg" filter, "Filter OD Groups" filter, "Filter Cabins" filter, "Indicators" filter)
You can "Redo " all Undos done since beginning the editing session. Once there are no more actions to redo, Redo controls no longer react.
You can "Reset " to come back to the initial state at the start of the editing session, and start your work over again.
When you "Reset", the system no longer remembers your accumulated actions to Undo and Redo, and your session starts again in the same editing mode you were using just prior to the
reset.
You can "undo" and "redo" the addition of Min Avail to a class as part of the Departure Inventory's normal undo / redo / reset functionality.
Posting the changes to the CRS
AU changes cannot be Posted until the departure has been optimized. Optimization of the departure can be accomplished through the Action Panel - Optimize. Choose the "Selection" and
"Launch". Upon successful Optimization, Posting can be done.
You can switch between Leg and OD and Post. Both Leg and OD changes to inventory will be posted.
Clicking on the "Post " button uploads the changes to the inventory. Check the Notification Bell for information on the post's success. If you Post, other users editing the same Departure will be
blocked from posting until they refresh their data.
You cannot "Undo" a Post (approve & post) action.
If you leave an editing session without Posting, all changes made in the session will be lost.

In rare cases, only some of the AUs of a given departure are successfully posted to the CRS. This is indicated by a notification bubble with the text "Partially Posted | Not all AUs were posted
because the inventory setup has changed".
This occurs in the following circumstances:
The departure's nesting structure has changed in Appia, preventing control classes in Appia from matching control classes found in the CRS. This must be resolved with the help of
ExPretio's operations support.
The leg list on the departure has changed. This is usually resolved with the overnight batch.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Departure Inventory allows you to select Leg view or OD view depending on whether or not the departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration.

71Advance Purchase
Overview
The Advance Purchase strategy allows users to automatically close Control Classes a certain number of Days Before Departure.
Sometimes referred to as an Apex strategy, the primary objective is to automate the closure of lower control classes that are associated with Fare products targeting advance purchase
customers.
This is achieved by setting a Journey’s Inventory (AUs) to zero at the control class level.
Benefits
Prevent Revenue Dilution .

72AU Setting and Final AU Setting
Overview
The AU Setting and Final AU Setting Strategies allow users to open, close or maintain a certain level of AU or Availability in Control Classes.
They automatically assign AU or Availability values in one or more control classes to an absolute or relative value. It is a very flexible strategy that, used with conditions, can cover a wide range of
business use cases.
AU Setting is Pre-Processing, and Final AU Setting is Post-Processing. As part of the Pre-Processing Rule context, AU Setting Strategies allow Control Class AUs to be set higher than that of its
parent Control Class, thus setting all parents control classes to the given AU value, while none the less being bounded by the Cabin’s Capacity.
The Final AU Setting Strategy is almost identical to the AU Setting Strategy, but differs in one important way: Rules implemented using this strategy are applied during the Post-Processing
execution context, as opposed to the Pre-Processing context. As a result, assignments are applied to Optimized AUs or Availabilities, as opposed to Observed values. Consequently, these
assignments are not taken into consideration by the numerical solver — e.g., in order to satisfy an objective function and various optimization constraints — , thus yielding outcomes that are more
deterministic: the effects of these assignments are restricted to the Control Classes defined in the strategy itself. Existing AU/Avl values on parent Control Classes are not adjusted to
accommodate a Rule Strategy action defined on a given Control Class.
Benefits
Protect revenue and market share or maintain consistent business offer eased by the flexibility of the action and conditions available inside this strategy
Protect high contributing OD s by defining control based on a percentage of the remaining Physical Capacity
Supports specific business situations such as handling Capacity Adjustments, managing network disruptions, controlling availability for specific distribution channels, supporting
promotional and marketing campaigns or implementing commercial policies
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "AU Setting" or "Final AU Setting" from the matrix list.
1
Limit the Scope of application of the strategy onto specific Journeys with a precondition. All conditions set in this section must be satisfied for the actions to be applied.
By using multiple conditions with different aggregation levels inside one precondition, it is possible to restrict the scope of application to a finer-grained element.
2
Restrict the scope of application of the strategy to a specific element (Journey, Cabin, Control Class, Leg, OD, OD Group) by setting conditions. All set conditions must be fulfilled for the
actions to be applied.
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
The AU Setting Strategy has a checkbox to specify if it is meant to apply to controlled ODs. If unchecked, it will apply only as a Leg Mode strategy.
3
4Sort the strategy's actions in the order you wish for them to be applied.
5Duplicate an action of the strategy.
Actions in the Final AU Setting strategy are applied sequentially and must therefore be set in ascending Class order, from the lowest Class to the highest one.
Define the operator: “MIN”, “MAX” or “SET”.
6
By default, you cannot use the same control class more than once except when using operators “MIN” and “MAX.” In that case, you can use the same control class in two distinct actions
to create an AU range [MIN; MAX].
AU ranges cannot be defined in the Final AU Setting because actions are applied sequentially. Only one action per Control Class can be set.
Define AU or Availability patterns using:
Exact value = an absolute value
AU Setting: % of Obs value = a percentage of the "Observed" values
Final AU Setting: % of Rec value = a percentage of the "Recommended" values
% of Ofr Cap = a percentage of the cabin capacity (only for the AU lever)
% of Ofr O-D Cap = a percentage of the remaining capacity of an OD (only for the AU lever)
7
8
AU Setting and Final AU Setting Strategies have been adapted for Hybrid Mode and have a checkbox to specify if it is meant to apply to controlled ODs. If unchecked, it will apply only as
a Leg Mode strategy. See the Hybrid Inventory mode section below.
Remarks
The Offered Capacity pattern is based on logical capacity. It doesn't take into consideration bookings made on overlapping ODs.
The offered OD capacity pattern is based on physical capacity. It takes into consideration Bookings made on overlapping ODs.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
AU and Final AU Setting Strategies are adapted for Hybrid Inventory Control Mode Departures.
73"Only apply Strategy to ODs included in OD Control Configurations" - "Checked or not" will not have an impact on Departures that don't have a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode. In other words, OD
Inventory Control Mode and Leg Inventory Control Mode inventory based departures will bypass this option, and be optimized according to their Inventory Control Mode.
For Departures in Hybrid Inventory Control Mode, with the OD Control Switch "Checked", and an OD Control Configuration exists, then the AU and Final AU Setting Strategies are applied to ODs
included in the OD Control Configuration. If an OD Control Configuration does not exist, the Strategies do not apply.
For Departures in Hybrid Inventory Control Mode, with the OD Inventory Control Switch "not Checked", the AU and Final AU Setting Strategies are applied in Leg Inventory Control Mode.
74Class Non-Reopening
Overview
The Class Non-Reopening strategy allows users to close one or more Control Classes permanently when their availability is less than or equal to 0.
It is used to prevent control classes from re-opening.
Benefits
Prevents price fluctuations
Supports the implementation of corporate guidelines pertaining to deeply discounted classes
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Class Non-Reopening" from the matrix list.
Pre-fill the strategy with "Select Control Classes" by:
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
Remarks
When the scope of a non-reopening strategy is the same as the one for a Competition Matching strategy :
The Non-Reopening strategy will prevail and
The system will apply the Competition Matching strategy actions only on control classes where there are no conflicts unless you specify a reopening action on the control class in the
Competition Matching strategy.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Class Non-Reopening will not be applied on a Departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and if the Departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration, and will be applied, in Leg
Inventory Control Mode, to a departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode that is not impacted by an OD Control configuration.
75Competition Matching
Overview
The Competition Matching Strategy allows to automatically close or open Control Classes to be above or below the prices offered by the competition.
Create tailored strategies:
First, set your targeted position in relation to that of your competitor(s) by using the Min Comp Cab Fare or Avg Comp Cab Fare,
Then define to what extent the Optimizer can reopen or close control classes to match the target.
The optimizer will adjust the Min Cab Avl Fare to the public price of the Cabin-control class that matches your target.
Linked Departure Preconditions will allow you to apply a strategy to other trains if train "A" meets a defined condition. For example, if the lowest fare is no longer available on a full departure,
other departure(s) could take over with the lowest available fare.
Benefits
Protect Revenue and Market Share
Adjust the strategy as conditions change
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Competition Matching" from the matrix list.
761In the Linked Departure Preconditions, enter the Departure Number(s) of trains that will have conditions.
2Set the Condition(s) for the Linked Departures. For example, if Departure Number 263, an afternoon Departure, with the lowest fare, reaches the threshold "Journey_Max_Leg_LF"
condition, then make other departures during the day, like Departure Number 200 in the morning, and Departure Number 270 in the evening, have the lowest fare available.
3Restrict the scope of application of the strategy to a specific element (Journey, Cabin, Control Class, OD, Leg, OD Group) by setting conditions. All set conditions must be fulfilled for the
actions to be applied.
Set Target
4Apply the strategy to one or more cabins.
5Select one or more competitors. You can have different strategies for different competitors. For example, you may want your price to be lower than that of a competing airline, but higher
than that of a low-cost competitor.
Base your strategy on the minimum or average competition fare.
First, choose a position :
below your competitor - your target will be the closest control class with a public price below your competitor's price.
as close to your competitor - your target will be the control class with a public price closest to your competitor's price. It can be either below or above.
above your competitor - your target will be the closest control class with a public price above your competitor's price
To further customize your strategy, click on Advanced Settings to either :
price match by level :
Level -1 - your target will be on the first control class with a public price below the target
Level -2 - your target will be on the second control class with a public price below the target
Level -3 - your target will be on the third control class with a public price below the target
Level +1 - your target will be on the first control class with a public price above the target
Level +2 - your target will be on the second control class with a public price above the target
Level +3 - your target will be on the third control class with a public price above the target
define a delta :
Below and as close to a delta of - your target will be the control class with a public price closest to the Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare - ∆
Strictly below a delta of - your target will be the control class with the first public price below the Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare - ∆
Above and as close to a delta of - your target will be the control class with a public price closest to the Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare + ∆
Strictly above a delta of - your target will be the control class with the first public price above the Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare + ∆

If your target price is lower than your current price, the optimizer will reopen the control classes to match your target.
To allow class reopening, you must define in the Reopen table a specific availability for each control class for which reopening is desired, expressed as a percentage of the O&D cabin’s
availability or as an exact value.
The percentage or exact value is considered by Appia as an upper limit only, not a strict value, as the availability of the control class may be restricted by that of the parent control class.
If your target price is higher than your current price, the optimizer will close the control classes to match your target.
You can add control classes in the exception list so that the optimizer doesn't close them.
To maximize the chances of non-closure actions being applied, users should define non-closure actions for each car control class, from highest to lowest.
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
10
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
Remarks
Operators retaining the services of a competitive intelligence service provider (CISP) may leverage the competitive data at their disposal in order to match their own product fares to those of
competitors. To that end, Appia uses competition data and the operator’s fare data, defined respectively in the competition-offer.XML and public-price.xml interfaces, in conjunction with the
Competition Matching BR strategy, which allows control classes to be closed or reopened, depending on whether the operator’s offered price is above or below a given target: control classes
with a price above the target remain open, while those with a price below the target are closed.
OD-based mode — AUs are adjusted on each OD-cabin with an existing Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare value.
Leg-based mode — AUs are adjusted on each leg-cabin included in the O&D with an existing Min/Avg Comp Cab Fare value.
When the scope of a Competition Matching strategy is the same as the one for a Class Non-Reopening strategy:
The Non-Reopening strategy will prevail and
The system will apply the Competition Matching strategy actions only on control classes where there are no conflicts unless you specify a reopening action on the control class in the
Competition Matching strategy.
Linked Departures must be on the same day, and there cannot be any loop where a strategy application is applied on both trains that would impact the other.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Competition Matching Strategy will not apply in Hybrid Inventory Control Mode.
77Initial Grouping
Overview
The Initial Grouping strategy allows users to define initial Inventory controls. This strategy is usually applied once when the Departure is Imported for the first time and meets certain conditions.
Later applications may occur for special events. E.g., unblocked Cabins.
Users can apply the Initial Grouping strategy for departures both in Leg or OD mode.
Benefits
Help prevent Spill and Spoilage situations
Reduces the number of strategies to create and maintain to initialize multiple ODs
Simplify business strategies’ maintenance by replacing your current AU Setting strategies, specifically set to catch newly created services, with the Initial Grouping strategy. This
method allows you to preserve any manual adjustments that you may want to do after initialization
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies and Strategy List. Select your desired Strategy from the list to edit.
781Save time and ensure you do not forget any Control Classes by pre-filling the strategy with the control classes of one or more Nesting.
2Define an AU pattern for multiple Journey Groupings in the same strategy. The template allows you to easily standardize AU patterns across journey groups.
3Automatically assign AUs as an absolute value or a percentage of the cabin Capacity. Percentage of cabin capacity allows you to define AU patterns independent of capacity difference
across your departures.
4Easily copy AUs from one journey group to another to save time.
5Choose to apply the strategy to departures in OD or leg mode (only available if you have departures in leg and OD mode).
6When you choose to apply the strategy to departures in OD mode, define the OD Group that you want to target. Optionally, you can apply a percentage increase or decrease to
personalize OD’s AU patterns compared to the rest of the group.
Remarks
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Initial Grouping will not be applied on a Departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and if the Departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration, and will be applied, in Leg Inventory
Control Mode, to a departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode that is not impacted by an OD Control configuration.
79Scoring
Overview
The Scoring Strategy allows a Journey to be Scored and Categorized automatically when all optional preconditions are true and when a given action’s conditional statement is true as well. If
multiple actions are defined, they are independent of one another.
Benefits
Sets alert on Departures or simply categorizes them based on their performance
Denotes a different meaning to a sco re ra ng e (i.e. 0-9) using both score and Tags, e.g. a range of Load Factors, revenues, Bookings, etc.
Allows to search for departures or define action conditions using score/tag
Instructions
Path: Open the Strategy List and select the button Create new Strategy. From the presented list, select the Scoring ANALYSIS.
1Set the Condition and/or Conditions criteria from the available list. Add the mathematical operator: + < >, and the numerical value. These apply at the
Cabin and Control Class levels. These two fields are independent of each other
2Set the Score (0-9) and its score colour
3Select or type the tag label
Remarks
Preconditions may be used, for instance, to close a promotional Control class when the Booking Speed and load factor exceed certain values.
Each scoring action may contain the following attributes:
Cabin – an optional cabin selected from a drop-down menu containing the full list of cabins
Control Class – an optional control class selected from a drop-down menu containing the full list of control classes
Condition(s) - an optional condition, containing one or more conditional statements, each related by the AND logical operator
Score – an integer ranging from zero (default) to 9
Tag – a user-defined, case-sensitive text label used to categorize journeys
The list of available indicators adjusts automatically as a function of the elements selected.
Element SelectionIndicator Level
NoneDeparture, Leg or OD
CabinDeparture, Leg, OD (at the cabin level)
Control ClassDeparture, Leg, OD or Control Class
Cabin and Control ClassDeparture, Leg, OD (at the cabin level)
You may assign to a departure either a score, a tag, or both. These can be useful when searching for departures with common attributes. Scores have no intrinsic meaning and therefore can be
used as codes to denote entirely different notions (e.g., 1 means "Spill", 2 means "high load factor", etc.) or as degrees associated with a concept (e.g., 1 means "leg load factor >= 85", 2 means
"leg load factor >= 70 and < 85", etc.).
For the strategy to be applied, all conditions of this action must be satisfied.
When you select a condition:
at the cabin level, you must select a cabin
at the control class level, you must select a control class
at the cabin and control class level, you must select a cabin and a control class.
Should two or more actions apply to the same departure, scores are aggregated using the maximum function and tags are cumulated.
Scoring and tagging are not persisted from one full Optimization to the next.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the tags may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
The Scoring strategy can be applied to Hybrid Inventory Control Mode departures.
80Linked Closure
Overview
The Linked Closure strategy allows you to close one or more Control Classes when another is also closed, whether these classes are all in the same Cabin or different cabins of the same
Journey.
The objective is to guarantee product fare coherence between the same or different cabins control classes because a Product offered in a lower cabin should never be priced higher than a
product in a superior cabin.
Benefits
Maintain price consistency
Manage complex Nesting (i.e. with several branches)
The control classes used in the actions of the strategy appear highlighted
Instructions
1
Restrict the Scope of application of the strategy to a specific element (Journey, Cabin, Control Class, OD, Leg, OD Group) by setting conditions. All set conditions must be fulfilled for the
actions to be applied.
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
2
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
3Define the closing of a subordinate class when its command class is closed.
Subordinate Control Classes may be parents of a command class, from a different nesting branch, or a separate cabin than those of their command class.
4Visualize links between command and subordinate Control Classes in a highlighted "Subordinate" nesting.
5Sort the strategy's actions by dragging them up or down in the order you wish them to be applied.
6Duplicate an action of the strategy.
7Delete an action of the strategy.
8Select an action line of a Control Class to display and highlight the colour-coded "Command" or "Subordinate" relationship.
9Visualize links between command and subordinate Control Classes in a highlighted "Command" nesting.
Actions that are below can override the ones above them if they impact the same elements.
Remarks
The highlight is triggered once you have selected the second Control Class then the interdependencies are displayed in two colors:
Subordinate (Yellow)
Command (Cyan)
What we call interdependencies is the link between the list of Control Classes and the table with the Cabins to the right of the interface, and conversely, if you start with the Command and the
Subordinate is empty, there will be no highlight, the condition for the highlight to take place is that the action is valid (the two Control Classes are selected).
Once a line has been configured with the two Control Classes, it is possible to highlight all of the configured lines, using a checkbox.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Linked Closure will not be applied on a Departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and if the Departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration, and will be applied, in Leg Inventory
Control Mode, to a departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode that is not impacted by an OD Control configuration.
81Linked Departure
Overview
Establish a Command-Subordinate price relation between two or more adjacent Departures to balance passenger loads.
The Linked Departure Strategy sets price levels on selected Departures based on their relation to the lowest available public price on the reference ("Command") Departure. Classes are opened
and closed on the target ("Subordinate") Departures to equal the price on the Command Departure, or else to exceed or undercut it by 1, 2, or 3 price levels.
Linked Departure (Inter-train) Strategies now have an inter-train Precondition "Journey Max Leg LF" capability, similar to Competition Matching. Before the addition, only the state of a
Subordinate train, defined in a Rule, could trigger a Linked Departure. But it is more common for an operator to want the state of another train as a trigger - often the Command Train that defines
the price level. Adding Preconditions to the Strategy allows this.
Not suitable for multi-branch Nestings.
Benefits
Protect Revenue and Market Share
Adjust the strategy as conditions change
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Linked Departure" from the matrix list.
Linked Departure Preconditions
You can set "Linked Departure Preconditions" for the Linked Departure Strategy. The Strategy is triggered only if the conditions are met on the Departures defined in the Precondition. These
include:
one or more Departure Numbers
Each Departure Number is linked to one or more sets of conditions
Multiple Departure Numbers are linked by "AND" logic. For example, if there are two lines, one for Departure Number 150 and one for Departure Number 250, the Strategy will only be applied if
both 150 and 250 meet the conditions.
Multiple c onditions are linked by "AND" logic. For example, "Journey_Max_Leg_LF > 30%" AND "Journey_Max_Leg_LF =< 70%" triggers the Strategy when the indicator is above 30% but no
greater than 70%.
Action - Adjust price level of the Subordinate Departures
You can define Subordinate departure(s) using Departure Number (in Network scope)
Rules:
There will be a Rule conflict when subordinate train is equal to command train
If no OD/Leg is specified, all shared ODs/Legs are impacted
You can position dependent departures depending on the command departure offer choosing one of the following matching levels:
Same price (by default)
If an identical price does not exist on the Subordinate departure, the closest price (higher or lower) will be selected
Below
Level -1 = 1st control class with a public price below command's price
Level -2 = 2nd control class with a public price below command's price
Level -3 = 3rd control class with a public price below command's price
Above
Level +1 = 1st control class with a public price above command's price
Level +2 = 2nd control class with a public price above command's price
Level +3 = 3rd control class with a public price above command's price
Strategy not suitable for multi-branch nestings
The levels are determined according to price level, not the actual sequence of Control Classes in the nesting. The following cases may give results where the effect of the rule doesn’t line up with
the strict class sequence:
If there are multiple branches in the nesting, price levels may be opened or closed regardless of which branch they are in. If the level is set to “+3”, and the first higher price level is in a
separate branch, then one class will close in one branch, and two classes in the other.
All the classes of the Subordinate Departure's nesting sharing the chosen price levels will be affected by the Strategy. If the Strategy applies a level of "+2", and the next 2 price levels
higher than the Command class are $200 and $250, and the Subordinate Departure, across all its branches, has 2 classes priced at $200 and 3 classes priced at $250, five classes will
be affected by the Strategy.
If a class in the nesting sequence does not have a public price, the class will be skipped and the Strategy will apply to the next class above or below, as long as it represents the next
affected price level.
82Specificities:
Dependent departures must have same departure date as command departure for the strategy/rule to apply
All linked departures must be part of the Optimization for the strategy/rule to apply
If a departure is dependent in different strategies or if there is a loop then rule priority must prevail
The Strategy is applied on a cabin-by-cabin basis. All cabins that exist on the Command Departure will be affected on the correspondingly-named cabins of the Subordinate Departure
Effect on Subordinate Departure's Availability
When a class that was open stays open after the Strategy is applied, its Availability is not affected by the Strategy.
When a class that was open is closed by the Strategy, its Availability goes to 0.
When a class that was closed is opened by the Strategy:
The Avail value of the target class (the class that lies at the chosen -3, -2, -1, 0, +1 , +2, +3 level) is based on the Avail of the lowest available class of the Command Departure.
Note that this only happens if the target class was previously closed. If it was previously open, its value is unaffected, unless other factirs (see next point) affect it.
Other classes are unaffected, but may be changed by one of these other factors:
To respect a nesting constraint as a result of the change to the target class
Optimization
Result of another Strategy
Remarks
Setting "+" or "-" is not the same as in Competition Matching .
This use of Price Levels is not quite the same as in Competition Matching Strategy.
Competition Matching is used in a context where the source for the price almost never exactly matches the any target price level . Setting "+1" and "-1" are used to point the
direction of matching upward or downward from the source price.
As Close To sets the price to the price closest to the competitor's lowest price, regardless of whether it is higher or lower
Above +1 also sets the price to the price closest to the competitor's lowest price, but chooses the closest upward
Below -1 also sets the price to the price closest to the competitor's lowest price, but chooses the closest downward
Linked Departure links with Departures from the same operator, and they most often share the same price structure . So "+1" and "-1" are assumed to always already be a step
up or down from the source price , even if the step up or down has to be from the price closest to the source.
Same sets the price to the price closest to the competitor's lowest price, regardless of whether it is higher or lower
+1 chooses a price level one above the price that is closest to the Command departure's lowest price
-1 chooses a price level one below the price that is closest to the Command departure's lowest price
So if the price structures don't match, then the system detects the nearest (above or below) and begins stepping up or down from there, which will produce a different result from a "+1" / "-1" in
Competition Matching. From the point of view of someone used to Competition Matching, the Price Level will appear to skip onward to the next price up or down, rather than just select the
closest.
The Departure defined in the Precondition may or may not be the actual Command Departure. As now, the Command Departure is set in the Strategy's "Action".
If you want to have the state of the Command Train trigger the Strategy, the same Departure must be configured in both the Precondition and the Action.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Linked Departure will not be applied on a Departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and if the Departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration, and will be applied, in Leg Inventory
Control Mode, to a departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode that is not impacted by an OD Control configuration.
83Linked Relation
Overview
The Linked Relation strategy allows users to protect revenue by establishing, under certain conditions, a command-subordinate relationship between two Control Classes using Authorized Selling
Levels (AUs) or Inventory availability (Avl).
Values of the subordinate class lever are related to that of the command class through a mathematical relationship involving an equality operator and a multiplicative factor.
Benefits
Ensures price consistency across products
Simplify Revenue Management by linking the behaviour of subordinate control classes to command control classes
Manage channel distribution , point of sales, etc. (only if specific Products or distribution channels are in specific control classes)
The control classes used in the actions of the strategy appear highlighted
Instructions
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
1
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
2Define the multiplicative factor that will link the behaviour of the subordinate Control Class to the Command one.
Subordinate Control Classes may be parents of a Command Class, from a different Nesting branch, or a separate Cabin than those of their Command Class.
Establish the command-subordinate relationship using authorized selling levels (AUs) or inventory availability (Avl).

Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Linked Relation will not be applied on a Departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and if the Departure is impacted by an OD Control Configuration, and will be applied, in Leg Inventory
Control Mode, to a departure with a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode that is not impacted by an OD Control configuration.
84OD Linked Relation
Overview
The OD Linked Relation strategy allows operators using an OD-based Seat Inventory Control mode to establish dependency relations between:
a Control Class on a set of subordinate ODs, and
a control class of a corresponding command OD on a given Departure
a control class on a higher-demand OD based on the Bookings of another OD in order to ensure no empty seats on the overall OD
Users can define the Command/Subordinate OD relations in the strategy.
The control classes' AU values associated with the subordinate ODs are set as a user-defined percentage of the AU or Availability of the corresponding command OD.
Benefits
Simplify the Revenue Management of multiple ODs by defining inventory controls only for the most important ODs and letting the others be automatically defined as a percentage of
the most important ODs
Ensure Price Consistency across ODs
Protect the revenue of more profitable ODs
Protect revenue for through traffic
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "OD Linked Relation" from the matrix list.

2
Optionally, define preconditions to be met when applying the OD Linked Relation strategy. Define a new “OD Type” condition to make it easier to define conditions on ODs used in this
strategy.
Restrict the scope of application of the strategy to a specific element (Journey, Cabin, Control Class, OD, Leg, OD Group) by setting conditions. All set conditions must be fulfilled for the
actions to be applied.
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
3adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
4Sort the strategy's actions in the order you wish for them to be applied.
5Duplicate an action of the strategy.
Actions that are below can override the ones above them if they impact the same elements.
For each dependency, define the:
Subordinate ODs and associated subordinate control class on which you want the inventory controls changed. You can select ODs manually or from an OD group and
Corresponding command OD and command control class to which you will link subordinate ODs.
6
You can apply each dependency relation to one or more OD to ease configuration and facilitate understanding and maintaining the strategy.
7
Define the dependency lever (Obs Bookings, Fcst Fnl Bookings, AU or Avl) and the lever's percentage to be applied on the subordinate OD's control class. Use the availability lever to link
the ODs inventory more closely, e.g., to make sure a subordinate OD’s control class closes when its corresponding command OD’s control class has closed.
Remarks
Define and visualize one or more dependency relations in the same strategy (e.g., for your entire nesting) to ensure they are coherent with each other.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
OD Linked Relation Strategy will not be available for Hybrid Inventory Control Mode.
85Price Consistency
Overview
The Price Consistency strategy prevents Fare Inversions on Departures at a Cabin and/or OD level.
The objective is to ensure the consistency of the commercial offer.
Benefits
Prevent Revenue Dilution
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Price Consistency" from the matrix list.
Use the checkboxes to apply Price Consistency at Cabin or OD level, or both.
Cabin Level ensures that, for a given OD, the O-DCabin_Min_Avl_Fare of the upper cabins is greater than that of the lower cabins.
OD Level ensures that for each cabin, the O-DCabin_Min_Avl_Fare on a longer OD is greater than or equal to that of a shorter OD.
When both Cabin and OD Level are used, the optimizer applies consistency first to the cabin level and then to the OD level to prevent conflicts within a given business Rule.

2
The informative illustrations show the application of a Price Consistency strategy at the Cabin Level and OD Level.
Remarks
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Price Consistency Strategy will not be available for Hybrid Inventory Control Mode.
86Spill Control
Overview
The Spill Control strategy allows users to close Control Classes when a Cabin Load Factor is reached.
Users can choose from 3 types of load factor levers and define closing patterns for the entire Horizon by defining thresholds per DBD.
This strategy is compatible with OD and Leg Inventory modes.
Benefits
Guarantees seats for high-fare passengers by controlling the Spill situation
Simplify the revenue management by defining a strategy for an entire sales horizon
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Spill Control (Appia V)" from the matrix list.
1
Limit the Scope of application of the strategy onto specific Departures with a precondition. All conditions set in this section must be satisfied for the actions to be applied.
By using multiple conditions with different aggregation levels inside one precondition, it is possible to restrict the scope of application to a finer-grained element.
2
Restrict the scope of application of the strategy to a specific element (Departure, Cabin, Control Class, OD, Leg, OD Group) by setting conditions. All set conditions must be fulfilled for the
actions to be applied.
Choose the Load Factor Closure Threshold:
For Leg and OD inventory modes:
Leg LF
when applied in leg mode, it is defined as the load factor of the legs
when applied in OD mode, it closes the control classes on all the ODs crossing the spilling leg
3
For OD inventory mode only:
OD LF: defined as the highest load factor of the OD'S constituting legs
AU LF: defined as the maximum AU of all control classes of the OD Cabin
Prefill the strategy with Control Class(es) by:
adding all Control Classes “From Nestings and Cabins” and/or
selecting specific ones “From all Control Classes”
4
When you add control classes via nesting selection, then the Cabin field is auto-filled with the correct cabin
5
6
Select the Checkpoints.
Sort the strategy's actions in the order you wish for them to be applied.
Actions that are below can override the ones above them if they impact the same elements.
7Duplicate an action of the strategy.
8Select the Cabin on which the LF lever will be evaluated. The Cabin field is auto-filled when you add control classes via nesting selection.
9
The system will automatically close control classes when the LF threshold is reached.
The threshold is evaluated within the CP ranges you have defined. The threshold set in the last column is evaluated within the range set by the last CP entry and the Departures.
Remarks
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
Spill Control Strategies are adapted for Hybrid Inventory Control Mode departures.
Spill Control Strategies are unaffected by Hybrid Inventory Control Mode, and without any OD Inventory Controls, they behave the same way as in Leg Inventory Control Mode.
Spill Control will be applied in:
Leg Inventory Control Mode when you are using a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and select a Leg LF, and
OD Inventory Control Mode when you are using a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode and select an OD/AU LF
87Spoilage Allocation
Overview
The spoilage allocation strategy allows analysts to instruct Appia to allocate the final forecasted excess capacity up to a defined maximum percentage. The optimizer uses a weighted average to
distribute the allocations at the control class level based on the expected forecast between the current and subsequent checkpoints.
Benefits
Drives incremental growth on off-peak markets
Increases efficiency by relying on forecast driven metrics
Minimize revenue dilution by decrementing spoilage allocations as the departure date approaches
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies. Select Create Strategy and "Spoilage Allocation" from the matrix list.
CabinSelect the desired cabin to evaluate the forecasted excess capacity in order to redistribute authorizations
Max AllocationDefine the percentage of authorizations to be redistributed within the Leg/OD-cabin based on the forecasted excess capacity
Remarks
The final forecasted Leg/OD-cabin capacity is calculated for the complete reservation horizon of the departure and recalculated at each application of the strategy.
The redistribution of authorizations maintains the protection level of the authorizations recommended by the optimizer, wherever feasible.
Protection: the number of authorizations reserved for specific control classes
Following the application of the strategy, the previously applied authorizations will be removed during the subsequent optimization and reapplied if necessary.
Cabin Distribution
Leg ModeOD Mode
To define how much spoilage will be available for a given leg, we
look at the final forecasted excess Leg capacity and based on the
maximum allocation, determine the number of authorizations to be
reallocated.To define how much spoilage will be available for a given OD, we look at the final forecasted
excess Leg capacity of the most constrained (max) Leg and based on the maximum
allocation, determine the total number of authorizations to be reallocated. We then allocate authorizations by
using the forecasted bookings for the current period on the relevant OD pairs that cross the constrained Leg,
weighting them according to the expected bookings for each pair.
Control Class
Distribution
Allocations determined at the Leg-cabin level are redistributed
according to the weighted forecasted demand of each control class
for the current period.
Exception:
If there are no forecasted bookings in the current period,
the authorizations will be redistributed to the lowest
available control class based on the nesting
Allocations determined at the OD-cabin level are redistributed according to the weighted
forecasted demand of each control class for the current period.
Exception:
If there are no forecasted bookings in the current period, then authorizations will not be
redistributed
If an analyst's objective is to allocate seats regardless of the forecasted demand, they should employ a Final AU Setting Strategy.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
Hybrid Inventory Control Mode
The Spoilage Allocation strategy is adapted for Hybrid Inventory Control Mode Departures.
"Only apply Strategy to ODs included in OD Control Configurations" - "Checked or not" will not have an impact on Departures that don't have a Hybrid Inventory Control Mode. In other words, OD
Inventory Control Mode and Leg Inventory Control Mode inventory based departures will bypass this option, and be optimized according to their Inventory Control Mode.
For Departures in Hybrid Inventory Control Mode, with the OD Control Switch "Checked", and an OD Control Configuration exists, then the strategy is applied to ODs included in the OD Control
Configuration. If an OD Control Configuration does not exist, the strategy do not apply.
For Departures in Hybrid Inventory Control Mode, with the OD Inventory Control Switch "not Checked", the strategy is applied in Leg Inventory Control Mode.

98Rule Priorities
Overview
Managers need to prioritize the application of Rules to control their RM strategy. Users need to view Rule Priorities to understand which Rules are currently applied.
When two or more Rules are in conflict, the Optimizer needs to know which Rule must be applied first.
Benefits
Control the application of Rules and the RM strategy
Understand the order in which Rules are applied
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Strategies and then Rule Priorities. A second path exists from the Rule List. When editing a Rule, there is a link at the bottom left of the window - "View

100OD Group
Overview
ODs can be grouped to facilitate RM processes. Assigning OD Groups to Rules and Strategies is an efficient way to apply Scope, and focus your analysis.
Benefits
Relieve OD management by commanding OD Groups instead of multiple ODs
Helps you manage RM processes for OD-based Seat Inventory Controls
Optimizes your daily analysis tasks
Improved ergonomics make it easier to create and manage OD Groups
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then OD Group.
The OD Group feature allows you to assign ODs sharing common business attributes based on distance, business importance or network characteristics, by selecting ODs and transferring them
over to the right panel. You can assign the OD Group a priority level as well as a colour to quickly help identify the group.
101Main OD
Overview
Operators using OD controls often have the following situation:
Most of the ODs of a Departure are not commercially relevant
The majority of the revenue is generated from a limited number of ODs
We need to prioritize the information for the most important ODs and their related strategies
Main OD Configuration allows you to configure the Main OD of a Departure to be able to identify and target them in the analysis workflow.
Benefits
Prioritizing key markets and routes : Identify the most important markets and routes based on factors such as ridership, revenue, and profitability. Focus resources and efforts on these
key areas to ensure optimal performance and customer satisfaction.
Using tools and automation : Take advantage of the business configuration tools, and automation available in the RM system.
Productivity : Getting the information of the most important ODs will enable a productivity gain since users will not have to configure their analysis screens to show this data.
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then Main OD Configuration.
Main ODs configurations can be prioritized. When a departure is included in several configurations for which main ODs have been configured, Appia must use the main OD of the configuration
with the highest priority.
Main OD is a mandatory field.
The following criteria are supported:
Network
Corridor
Departure Number
Destination Station
Operator
Origin Station
Portfolio
Region
Route
Service
Schedule
Arrival Time
Day of Week
Departure Date
Departure Time
Inclusion and exclusion are supported in creating a Main OD Configuration.
102Remarks
When a departure is included in one or more configurations for which main ODs have been configured, but that these main ODs are not served by this departure, then the main OD must be the
longest OD (i.e. the OD with same Origin Destination as the departure) of this departure.
When a departure is not included in any configuration for which main ODs have been configured, then the main OD must be the longest OD (i.e. the OD with same Origin/Destination as the
departure) of this departure.
When a departure Origin/Destination OD is not for sale, the main OD must be the OD for sale with the longest distance.
The following KPIs take the Main OD into account in their formula:
Rec Lowest Available Class (updated during an optimization)
Obs Lowest Available Class (updated during the nightly batch process)
Min Price (updated during the nightly batch process)
Rec Comp Delta (updated during an optimization)
Min Price and Rec Comp Delta are updated following a Competition Import. If a Main OD has been updated, the next time there is a Competition Import, both Min Price and Rec Comp Delta will
take the latest Main OD.
Regarding the Rec/Obs lowest available class,
1. The user creates/updates a Main OD configuration.
2. The Main OD changes are applied to the matching departure during the nightly batch process (import, recalculation, optimization, reports).
A Main OD update does not trigger the recalculation of the following KPIs:
Obs Lowest Available Class
Min Price
A Main OD update does not trigger the optimization of the departure so the following KPIs will not be updated:
Rec Lowest Available Class
Rec Comp delta
3. If, during the import, the system detects a recalculation trigger such as a Booking Threshold, then Obs Lowest Available Class will be updated with the latest Main OD.
4. If, after the import, the system detects an optimization trigger such as a Checkpoint, then Rec Lowest Available Class will be updated with the latest Main OD.
Recalculation and optimization triggers can differ, so there may exist a situation where the Rec Lowest Available Class that has been calculated with a different Main OD than the Obs Lowest
Available Class.
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.

Long routes where certain highly-travelled Legs are best managed as ODs, but managing the whole route in OD Mode would be cumbersome.
“Hybrid” Mode allows OD management for parts of a route whose inventory is otherwise managed in Legs.
An OD Control Configuration corresponds with :
A Scope
A list of ODs (market)
The OD Control Configuration will set OD controls for all Departures within the Scope criteria on the market (OD) defined in the configuration, and will apply to Departures in-transit or not
departed. Hybrid Mode without any OD Controls behaves the same way as departures in full Leg Mode.
Benefits
Allow the definition of selected station pairs of a Route to be inventory-managed as ODs
Optimize the Legs alongside the controlled ODs
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then OD Control.
Selecting "Create OD Control Configuration" opens the following form.
You must give your OD Control Configuration a Name. The Description is optional. By default the Configuration will be Active.
You must select an existing Scope, which you have the option to edit. A toggle switch will allow you to "Show only my Scopes" in the drop-down list. The Criteria Summary will display the Scope Criteria
which is at the Departure level. The total number of Departures in Transit and not Departed will display.
Add an OD (Market) for the Configuration. The list of ODs is not limited by the Scope. The Scope and OD selection is an "and" association.
Remarks
When deactivating or deleting an OD Control Configuration you will be warned that all ODs included in the configuration will no longer have OD-based controls. OD controls that don't match any
OD Control Configurations will be removed during the next optimization.
Any newly created or modification made to an OD Control Configuration requires a re-optimization in order to apply the controls. You can do that by selecting a Scope or a Departure from the
Departure List and running an optimization from the Action Panel.
OD control configurations are required in order to apply strategies at the OD level on hybrid departures.
Some Scope criteria may be incompatible with this configuration. Adjust the criteria or save as a new Scope.
Incompatible criteria includes:
Cabin LF
Capacity
Fnl RASK
Fnl Yield
RASK
Rec Lwst Avl Cls
Rec Cabin Lwst Avl Cls
Yield
Weekly Bkg Spd
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
104Special Events
Overview
The Special Events Configuration allows you to define special events that will impact origin & destination pairs in order to adapt your RM strategy before, during and after those events.
Different types of events can affect a departure/OD demand:
Holidays - such as statutory or bank holidays, school holidays, summer vacations, or spring break
Maintenance - Rail network and equipment maintenance such as equipment failures, rail obstructions, planned repairs
Social Movements - Labour strikes, protest marches, etc.
Unforeseen events - Natural disasters, artificial disasters, conflicts, or criminal acts
Benefits
Enable the user to have a better understanding of why OD demand is higher or lower than expected
Historical holiday definitions give reference to demand patterns or characteristics
If impacted by an event, ODs and their respective departures will be flagged and the event can be used in Rules and Scopes criteria
The forecast accounts for special events that impact the network
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then Special Events.
The following search fields can be used to create Special Event Criteria in order to target departures impacted by the Special Event.Criteria are optional, narrowing the conditions of the configuration:

From the OD selector a multi-select list, one or more ODs can be selected. A wild-card option allows for an origin station to all destination stations (MAN - *), or from all origin stations to a
particular destination station ( * - MAN). ODs are optional, further narrowing the conditions of the configuration. If no ODs are selected, all ODs will be included.
Remarks
105Special Event Configurations are limited to 100 days. If you encounter an event the surpasses this limit, we recommend creating two separate events.
In the Special Events Configuration, Criteria and/or ODs are optional, further narrowing the conditions of the configuration. If no ODs are selected, all ODs will be included.
The Event Date is associated with the OD Departure Date.
The Special Event Configuration is like a “mini-Scope” that can be added to an existing scope, further funneling conditions.
Special events may have an influence on forecasting models at the OD level.

107Rule-Based
Overview
The Rule-Based Configuration is used to optimize Departures using the Rule-Based Optimization Mode instead of the Forecast-Based Optimization Mode driven by historical data.
Benefits
Prevents the application of forecasts during the optimization of Departures for specific situations such as:
Introduction of a new Market without historical data
Events or a dynamic environment impacting the existing markets
Introduction of a new price structure, etc.
Instructions
Rule-Based Configuration List
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then Rule-Based Configuration.
Click "+ Create Configuration" to open the Rule-Based Configuration creation template (See below)

Departures matching the Rule-based configuration scope are optimized in rule-based mode.
The configuration is considered inactive by default. You can activate it by sliding the Active button to ON.
Choose to apply to all departures or select a Scope from the drop-down list. A toggle switch will allow you to "Show only my Scopes" in the drop-down list. The total number of Departures is
displayed.
The Criteria Summary displays the selected scope criteria. By selecting All Departures, the configuration applies to all departures.
The Effective Dates allows you to choose dates for "From" and "To" calendars.
Remarks
Usually, we will exclude a limited number of Departures from forecast-based mode, so in the rule-based configuration, it is easier to temporarily specify the trains to be optimized in Rule-Based
(excluded from forecast) and optionally add the departure dates.
Some Scope criteria may be incompatible with this configuration. Adjust the criteria or save as a new Scope.
Incompatible criteria includes:

108109Competition
Overview
Competition Configuration in Appia V allows you to map competitor data to your own OD departures.
Mapping a competitor's departure means identifying it as a competitor to a specific one of your OD departures on the same market. For example, you can set a configuration to treat any
competitor OD that departs within 30 minutes of any of your OD departures as a competitor for that departure. That mapping is then used in strategies relating to competition.
The Competition Configuration screen allows you to:
Define the default configuration - a general rule for mapping competitors' departures to yours
Create, edit, and duplicate Exceptions , to identify and map competitors for special times, markets, and other circumstances. Exceptions are similar to the default configuration, but have
additional criteria to make more targeted selections both among your own OD departures and the competitors' departures.
Re-order the priority of Exceptions
Benefits
Competitive insights
Increase flexibility to map competition data
Mapped competitive departures highlighted in the Competition Analysis widget
Competition KPIs based on the mapped competitors
Instructions
Path: From the left sidebar in Appia, Select Business Configuration and then Competition Configuration.
The following information will be displayed for all existing configurations:
110ReferenceDeparture
Arrival
(OD Departure and
Arrival)A reference period (Station Departure time or Arrival time). By default the comparison reference is "Station Departure time" and the
default value of the time interval is 30 minutes for both bounds
Time FrameTime Interval: Before,
After
Time of Day: From, ToA Time Frame is a period of time in which to identify competitor departures.
A time interval is a range before and after each for your OD departures' times (station departure time or station arrival time) in which
to map competitors. It is defined by a lower AND an upper bound in hours and minutes. The lower and upper bound can be
asymmetrical. The values within a bound cannot exceed 48 hours and be inferior to 1 minute.
A time of day is a period in the day in which an OD departure of yours departs or arrives. Competitors whose departure or arrival
times are found in the same period are mapped. It is defined by both a lower and upper bound. The lower and upper bound must be
between 00:00 and 23:59 on the same calendar day.
RankPriority of exception. A newly created exception will be ranked last. You can change the rank of existing exceptions

Remarks
Each node in an inventory structure corresponds to a unique inventory Control class, which will be used to protect a certain number of seats that will be available to the Commercial classes contained in that
control class. When a Control class is open, its Commercial classes (and those of its parent classes) have access to the remaining seats assigned to that class (and those of its children). Once a Control class is
closed, no seats will be available for sale to its Commercial class, nor to those of its children.
Appia Control class: A set of capacity units on a journey, controlled jointly by the Revenue Management system either at the leg or OD level. A control class is associated with
one or more fare basis, and with one or more commercial classes
Appia Commercial class: A designator used to group OD fares that are managed together for commercial purposes. Each commercial class usually corresponds to a unique price
point of a Product (with its corresponding OD fares). Commercial classes of comparable economic value are grouped and assigned to control classes to be managed as inventory
capacity units. Commercial classes are normally indexed to different control classes for the various ODs.
Appia can support a wide variety of inventory configurations, but a journey can only use one.
You can define their nesting and indexing information externally and then have them loaded into Appia to manage diverse types of control classes. The Revenue Management System (RMS) can
connect to the CRS to Import and export data and to facilitate mass inventory controls.
UNDX Cabin: When a journey contains one or more bookings that are associated with a commercial class that is not part of the current indexing or have a commercial class that is part of the
indexing associated with a given control class, but the latter is not part of the nesting, then those Bookings are placed in the "UNDX" cabin ( unindexed).
Please be aware that some legacy reference data in the criteria lists may be hidden based on settings in the Data Display Preferences.
122KPI Summary
