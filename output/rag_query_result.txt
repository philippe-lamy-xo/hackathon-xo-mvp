QUERY:
I have a train with journey key = 100 and load factor = 0.8 and another train with journey key = 200 and load factor = 0.5, which one is the best and which one is the worst and why

ANSWER:
Best journey: 100 (higher load factor = better utilization). Worst journey: 200 (lower load factor = poorer utilization).
Reasoning: A higher load factor indicates more seats occupied relative to capacity, which typically reflects better revenue and efficiency unless other constraints apply.
